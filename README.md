# Computing for International Schools

This is a complete curriculum designed for schools internationally and covering Grades 5 through 7. Each grade includes 35-40 hours of teaching and learning content and uses the Arm School Program’s project-based learning pedagogical approach. The course is based on the use of micro:bits and MicroPython.

## Resource Aim
This course introduces learners to the key STEM topics of physical computing, sensors, programming and Internet of Things (IoT) through project-based learning. Learners will be immersed in a series of projects which involve rapid team-based development of a solution to meet specified criteria.  

## Learning Outcomes
- Learners will demonstrate relevant and comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the concepts and principals involved in the course
- Learners will effectively apply the principles and concepts using sustained analytical and evaluative thinking and practice in order to solve a range of problems
- Learners will demonstrate their ability to apply knowledge and understanding to solve substantial problems in an efficient manner
- Learners will collaborate successfully with their peers and demonstrate effective communication as well as efficient and effective teamwork

## Resource Structure
- Grade 5 – Introduction to micro:bit - 40 lessons
- Grade 6 – IoT and Robotics - 40 lessons
- Grade 7 -  micro:python – 34 lessons

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.

Contact us at school@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
